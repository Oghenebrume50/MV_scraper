# MV_scraper
This is a project that would help me review Microverse projects on time, by checking my dashboard for available reviews and automatically claiming them on my behalf then notifying me immediately via an sms to my mobile phone 

## TECHNOLOGIES 
- Ruby
- GEMS
  - Watir
  - Twilio-ruby
  - headless
  - dotenv
    
## SETUP
 This project is for my productivity at my job so it is custom to me alone 
   I made this executable so I just run the file whenever I need it, running 'review" runs the program
   
## Improvements
For now there is no plan to improve, program does its task efficiently and I cannot think of any extra functionality that is needed
